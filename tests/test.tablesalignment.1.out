MAN(6)                                                     MAN(6)

NAME

man - macros to typeset manual

SYNOPSIS

nroff -man file ...

troff -man file ...

DESCRIPTION

These macros are used to format pages of this manual.

Except in `.LR' and `.RL' requests, any text argument
denoted t in the request summary may be zero to six words.
Quotes " ... " may be used to include blanks in a `word'.
If t is empty, the special treatment is applied to the next
text input line (the next line that doesn't begin with dot).
In this way, for example, .I may be used to italicize a line
of more than 6 words, or .SM followed by .B to make small
letters in `bold' font.

A prevailing indent distance is remembered between succes-
sive indented paragraphs, and is reset to default value upon

reaching a non-indented paragraph.  Default units for
indents i are ens.

The fonts are

R	roman, the main font, preferred for diagnostics
I	italic, preferred for parameters, short names of com-
	mands, names of manual pages, and naked function names
`B'	`bold', actually the constant width font, preferred for
	examples, file names, declarations, keywords, names of
	struct members, and literals (numbers are rarely liter-
	als)
L	also the constant width font.  In troff L=B; in nroff
	arguments of the macros .L, .LR, and .RL are printed in
	quotes; preferred only where quotes really help (e.g.
	lower-case literals and punctuation).

Type font and size are reset to default values before each
paragraph, and after processing font- or size-setting mac-
ros.

The -man macros admit equations and tables in the style of
eqn(1) and tbl(1), but do not support arguments on .EQ and
.TS macros.

These strings are predefined by -man:

\*R	`(Reg)', trademark symbol in troff.
\*S	Change to default type size.

REQUESTS

Request	Cause	If no		Explanation
		Break	Argument
.B t		no		t=n.t.l.*		Text t is `bold'.
.BI t	no		t=n.t.l.		Join words of t alternating bold and
							italic.
.BR t	no		t=n.t.l.		Join words of t alternating bold and
							Roman.
.DT		no					Restore default tabs.
.EE		yes					End displayed example
.EX		yes					Begin displayed example
.HP i	yes		i=p.i.*		Set prevailing indent to i. Begin para-
							graph with hanging indent.

* n.t.l. = next text line; p.i. = prevailing indent

BUGS

There's no way to fool troff into handling literal double
quote marks " in font-alternation macros, such as `.BI'.
There is no direct way to suppress column widows in 2-column
output; the column lengths may be adjusted by inserting
`.sp' requests before the closing `.1C'.
