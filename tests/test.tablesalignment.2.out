NAME

tbl - format tables for nroff or troff

SYNOPSIS

tbl [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION

Tbl is a preprocessor for formatting tables for nroff or
troff(1). The input files are copied to the standard output,
except for segments of the form

	 .TS
	 options ;
	 format .
	 data
	 .T&
	 format .
	 data
	 . . .
	 .TE

which describe tables and are replaced by troff requests to
lay out the tables.  If no arguments are given, tbl reads
the standard input.

The (optional) options line is terminated by a semicolon and
contains one or more of

	center		center the table; default is left-adjust
	expand		make table as wide as current line length
	box
	doublebox	enclose the table in a box or double box
	allbox		enclose every item in a box
	tab(x)		use x to separate input items; default is
				tab
	linesize(n)	set rules in n-point type
	delim(xy)		recognize x and y as eqn(1) delimiters

Each line, except the last, of the obligatory format
describes one row of the table.  The last line describes all
rows until the next .T&, where the format changes, or the
end of the table at .TE.  A format is specified by key let-
ters, one per column, either upper or lower case:

	L	Left justify: the default for columns without for-
		mat keys.
	R	Right justify.
	C	Center.
	N	Numeric: align at decimal point (inferred for
		integers) or at `\&'.
	S	Span: extend previous column across this one.
	A	Alphabetic: left-aligned within column, widest
		item centered, indented relative to L rows.
	^	Vertical span: continue item from previous row
		into this row.
	-	Draw a horizontal rule in this column.
	=	Draw a double horizontal rule in this column.

Key letters may be followed by modifiers, also either case:

	|		Draw vertical rule between columns.
	||		Draw a double vertical rule between columns.
	n		Gap between column is n ens wide.  Default is 3.
	Ffont	Use specified font. B and I mean FB and FI.
	T		Begin vertically-spanned item at top row of
			range; default is vertical centering (with `^').
	Pn		Use point size n.
	Vn		Use n-point vertical spacing in text block;
			signed n means relative change.
	W(n)	Column width as a troff width specification.
			Parens are optional if n is a simple integer.
	E		Equalize the widths of all columns marked E.

Each line of data becomes one row of the table; tabs sepa-
rate items.  Lines beginning with `.'  are troff requests.
Certain special data items are recognized:

	_	Draw a horizontal rule in this column.
	=	Draw a double horizontal rule in this column.  A
		data line consisting of a single `_' or `=' draws
		the rule across the whole table.
	\_	Draw a rule only as wide as the contents of the
		column.
	\Rx	Repeat character x across the column.
	\^	Span the previous item in this column down into
		this row.
	T{	The item is a text block to be separately format-
		ted by troff and placed in the table.  The block
		continues to the next line beginning with T}.  The
		remainder of the data line follows at that point.

When it is used in a pipeline with eqn, the tbl command
should be first, to minimize the volume of data passed
through pipes.

EXAMPLES

Let <tab> represent a tab (which should be typed as a gen-
uine tab).
